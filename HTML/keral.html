        <p class="size">The term Kerala was first epigraphically recorded as' (Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka of Magadha.<br>
        <ol class="size"><b>Ancient Period:</b> Kerala has a history dating back to ancient times, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Neolithic era. The region was known as "Chera Nadu" and was ruled by the Chera dynasty, one of the four major kingdoms mentioned in ancient Indian texts.</ol><br>
        <ol class="size"><b>Medieval Period:</b> Kerala's history during the medieval period is marked by the arrival of various dynasties, including the Cholas, Pandyas, and later the powerful Zamorin rulers of Calicut. The region became a center for trade, particularly in spices like pepper, cardamom, and cinnamon, attracting traders from across the globe.</ol> <br>
        <ol class="size"><b>Colonial Era:</b> Kerala's strategic location on the Malabar Coast made it an attractive destination for European powers seeking to establish trade routes to India. The Portuguese were the first to arrive in the late 15th century, followed by the Dutch and the British. The British East India Company gained control over Kerala by the 18th century, leading to British colonial rule.</ol> <br>
        <ol class="size"> <b>Independence and Post-Independence:</b> Kerala played a significant role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. After India gained independence in 1947, Kerala became a state in 1956, following the reorganization of Indian states based on linguistic lines. Since then, Kerala has made remarkable progress in various fields, including education, healthcare, and social welfare, earning it the nickname "God's Own Country."</ol> <br>
        <ol class="size"> <b>Cultural Heritage: </b>Kerala is renowned for its vibrant culture, which is a blend of indigenous traditions, art forms, festivals, and culinary delights. The state is known for its classical dance forms like Kathakali and Mohiniyattam, traditional music, literature, and architecture, including the iconic backwaters, lush greenery, and serene beaches.
